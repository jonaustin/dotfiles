# zsh - split words by default
# zsh does not split words by default as described http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq03.html, which makes it difficult to work with $fs and $fx variables, but a compatibility option named shwordsplit (-y or --sh-word-split) is provided for this purpose. You can set this option for all commands as such:
set shell zsh
set shellopts '-euy'
set ifs "\n"
set filesep "\n"  # default already

# allow c-z to work
map <c-z> $ kill -STOP $PPID

# open with
cmd open-with %"$@" "$fx"
map ` push :open-with<space>

# preview toggle
# set preview
# set previewer "less -k ~/.config/lf/less.lesskey"

set previewer ~/opt/_go/bin/pistol
